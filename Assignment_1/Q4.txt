Q4: Write a short note on Tag and element with an example?

Tag:

A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets ("<>" and "</>").
Tags are used to mark the beginning and end of elements and provide instructions to web browsers on how to render content.

Element:

An element is a combination of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, representing a distinct unit of content within an HTML document.
The opening tag (<tag>) marks the beginning of the element, the closing tag (</tag>) marks its end, and the content is the data enclosed within these tags.

Example: <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>

here <p> is the opening tag and </p> is the closing tag and the content between the tags(This is a sample paragraph).The combination of opening tag , closing tag and content is known as element.
